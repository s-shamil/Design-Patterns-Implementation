Suppose you are going to develop a software for facilitating transfer of information
among the students of your class. Any student of your class can subscribe or
unsubscribe from the service of the software. Whenever the class representative gets to
know some information regarding any academic issue, s/he inputs the information to the
software as a text segment and then this message is emailed to all subscribed students.
