Consider a vending machine which dispenses soft drinks when a coin is inserted.
However, this service depends on some factors such as inventory of the machine,
amount of currency deposited, the ability to make change, the item selected, etc. When
currency is deposited and a selection is made, a vending machine will either deliver a
product and no change, deliver a product and change, deliver no product due to
insufficient currency on deposit, or deliver no product due to inventory depletion.
